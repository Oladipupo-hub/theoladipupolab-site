## Investigating socioeconomic drivers of urban pest prevalence

We are building a research program that proves urban pest problems are fundamentally equity problems. Our lab investigates how income disparities, housing conditions, and neighborhood resources drive pest infestations in wide variety of lived experiences. Using GIS mapping, community surveys, and population genetics, we reveal persistence patterns while examining biological factors that complicate control in resource-limited settings.
