Narrative reviews gather evidence but lack empirical synthesis. Conversely, meta-analysis quantitatively combines effect sizes from multiple studies addressing similar hypotheses, revealing general patterns objectively. Despite limitations (file drawer problem, publication quality variations), meta-analysis powerfully identifies patterns in data-rich disciplines like agriculture, ecology, psychology, medicine, and education where large, under-analyzed datasets abound

Our class teaches students in agricultural and environmental sciences to master meta-analysis techniques for extracting meaningful insights from scattered research findings
