  We are broadly interested in developing sustainable urban pest management solutions through interdisciplinary research. Our lab uses diverse approaches – biotechnology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics – to understand host-microbe interactions and the functional roles of microbiomes in urban insect pests. Additionally, we integrate socioeconomic research on pest prevalence to create comprehensive, eco-friendly management strategies.

## Some areas of focus are:
- Investigating socioeconomic drivers of urban pest prevalence
- Understanding microbiome influence on urban pest life history traits
- Creating translational tools for real-world applications
- Developing sustainable pest control strategies
